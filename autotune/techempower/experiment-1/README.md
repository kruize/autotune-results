## All the experiments in this folder were run on shared infrastructure and require to be validated on a dedicated infrastructure. Manual runs are being run to reproduce the data with the best configuration which will be updated at [manuals](https://github.com/kruize/autotune-results/tree/main/techempower/experiment-1/manuals) dir.


# Summary of data
- 19.2% reduced response time with optuna optimization tunables.
- Min response time is observed with following configuration
