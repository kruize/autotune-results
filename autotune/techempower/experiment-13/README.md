## All the experiments in this folder were run on dedicated infrastructure.

# Goal of the experiment:
- Minimize transaction response time.

- For details on slo and benchmark, look into [benchmark.yaml](benchmark.yaml)

# Summary of data
- Min response time is observed with following configuration
```
   [Layer]            [Tunable]              [Default, Range]      Best Config
[Container] 	      cpuRequest             [None, 1-8]             =    7.8
[Container]           memoryRequest          [None, 270M-4096M]      =  2598M
[Hotspot]             GCPolicy		     [ , ]		     =  ParallelGC

```
The above experiment is to find which GCPolicy is suitable for the available cpu and memory. Tunables used for this experiment are cpu, memory and GCPolicy. Requests and limits of cpu and memory resources is set to same.

- Trial 66 is considered as the best configuration in the experiment.
- The best configuration from the experiment uses ParallelGC which showed high Throughput and lower Response time.


Below are the best configurations from each GCPolicy in this experiment. All the trial data is available at [experiment-data.csv](experiment-data.csv),

### Configuration Details:
```
- JDK                   eclipse-temurin:17
- Quarkus               1.13.2.F
```
- Machine: 
```
  - Server:  openshift cluster v4.8.13
    Master nodes	3
    Worker nodes	3
    CPU per node	56
    Memory per node	512G

  - Client: RHEL 8.3
    CPU  		64
    Memory 		512G  
```
- Load: 
```
 	Users :		512
	Threads :	56
```


Note: Best configuration from multiple trials is picked based on having least response time with good throughput, no errors while running the load and ensuring the data has met the convergence criteria.
Each trial would have an individual configuartion based on the tunables.For information on the configuration of a particular trial, look into experiment-data.csv
